Quick Usage : Just download the `GalibMusicPlayer.html` and from file manager, open in chrome. No server needed!

# G-Music
G-Music pushes the limits of web audio player to extremes by using the Web Audio API and also comes with butter fluid animation/bvisualiser and next-gen playlist management system.
Built on a single html file, the HTML file can run on `FILE://` protocol by bypassing crossorigin errors using a proxy server. I cannot type here the source of music,
if you are average dev you will find it out soon. 

This is the most advanced music player as far as i have seen on the web!
